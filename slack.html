    <!-- Section 1: What Slack Is -->
    <h1>What Slack Is (and Why Teams Use It)</h1>
    <p>
      <strong>Slack</strong> is the primary communication tool used by most modern engineering teams.
      While it may look similar to familiar messaging apps, its purpose is very different. Slack is
      designed for structured, searchable, team-wide communication that supports ongoing work rather
      than casual conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unlike personal messaging apps, Slack is built around the idea that work conversations should be
      <strong>visible</strong>, <strong>recoverable</strong>, and <strong>connected</strong> to the tools
      where work actually happens. Messages are not just exchanged; they are contextualized within
      channels, projects, and integrations.
    </p>
    <p class="tip-box">
      For junior developers, Slack is often the first place where professional communication habits
      are learned—and unlearned.
    </p>

    <!-- Section 2: Slack vs WhatsApp -->
    <h2>Slack Compared to WhatsApp (and WhatsApp Groups)</h2>
    <p>
      At first glance, Slack feels similar to WhatsApp: you send messages, reply to people, and receive
      notifications. This is exactly why many juniors instinctively use Slack as if it were WhatsApp.
      That instinct is understandable—but misleading.
    </p>

      <div class="compare-box-secondary">
        <h4>WhatsApp (Personal Chat)</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Optimized for private, real-time conversation</li>
          <li>Messages are chronological</li>
          <li>Context fades quickly</li>
          <li>Groups mix multiple topics</li>
          <li>Works well for social coordination</li>
          <li>Hard to reference later</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Slack (Work Communication)</h4>

          <li>Messages searchable months later</li>
          <li>New members see historical context</li>

          <li>Information written to be understood later</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p class="tip-box">
      <strong>Mental shift:</strong> WhatsApp is about talking to people.
      Slack is about communicating within a system.
    </p>

    <!-- Section 3: How Slack Organizes Work -->
    <h2>How Slack Organizes Work Conversations</h2>
    <p>
      Slack's core strength is that conversations are not just messages—they are
      <strong>structured discussion spaces</strong>.
    </p>

    <h3>Channels</h3>
    <p>
      Channels act as shared rooms with a clear purpose. Instead of asking "who should I message?",
      you usually ask "<strong>which channel does this belong in?</strong>". This alone changes how
      teams communicate: discussions become discoverable, decisions become visible, and information
      stops living in private inboxes.
    </p>

    <h3>Threads</h3>
    <p>
      Threads further reinforce this structure. Rather than fragmenting conversations across dozens of
      short messages, Slack allows replies to stay attached to the original message. This keeps channels
      readable and makes it possible to follow multiple discussions in parallel without losing context.
    </p>

    <p class="flow-diagram">
      The result is communication that is <strong>calmer</strong>, more <strong>deliberate</strong>,
      and easier to reason about—especially when many people are involved.
    </p>

    <!-- Section 4: Slack Is Not a Task Manager -->
    <h2>Slack Is Not a Task Manager—but It Can Track Work</h2>
    <p>
      Slack itself is not where tasks are formally defined, but it plays an important role in how work
      is discussed and followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Messages can be saved, reminders can be set, and integrations allow updates from other systems to
      appear directly in channels. In practice, this means Slack often acts as a <strong>signal layer</strong>:
      you see that something changed, needs attention, or requires coordination.
    </p>
    <p class="tip-box">
      For junior developers, the key point is to avoid treating Slack as a replacement for structured
      task tracking. Instead, it should be understood as the place where work is <strong>coordinated
      in real time</strong>, while the authoritative record of tasks lives elsewhere (like Jira).
    </p>

    <!-- Section 5: Slack and Jira Together -->
    <h2>Working with Slack and Jira Together</h2>
    <p>
      Slack and Jira are designed to <strong>complement each other</strong> rather than compete.
    </p>

    <div class="compare-grid">
      <div class="compare-box-primary">
        <h4>Jira (Structured Work)</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Tasks defined formally</li>
          <li>Priorities assigned</li>
          <li>Ownership tracked</li>
          <li>Status recorded</li>
          <li>The authoritative record</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="compare-box-secondary">
        <h4>Slack (Conversational Layer)</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Questions asked</li>
          <li>Clarifications made</li>
          <li>Coordination happens</li>
          <li>Quick alignment between people</li>
          <li>Real-time interaction</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>
      In practice, discussions often start in Slack and are then anchored in Jira. A question might be
      asked in a channel, clarified through a short exchange, and then reflected in the relevant ticket.
      Updates from Jira can also appear automatically in Slack, allowing teams to stay informed without
      constantly switching tools.
    </p>
    <p class="tip-box">
      For junior developers, the important skill is not mastering integrations, but understanding
      <strong>why both tools exist</strong> and what role each one plays. Slack is where you interact
      with people; Jira is where the work itself is recorded.
    </p>

    <!-- Section 6: Professional Communication -->
    <h2>Professional Communication Expectations</h2>
    <p>
      Because Slack feels informal, it is easy to forget that it is still a <strong>professional
      workspace</strong>. Messages are persistent, searchable, and often visible to people outside
      your immediate team. Writing clearly, providing context, and being mindful of tone matters more
      here than in casual messaging apps.
    </p>

    <div class="checklist-box">
      <h4>Effective Slack Communication</h4>
      <ul class="checklist">
        <li>Favor complete thoughts over rapid back-and-forth</li>
        <li>Prioritize clarity over speed</li>
        <li>Use shared context over private side conversations</li>
        <li>Write messages that can be understood asynchronously</li>
        <li>Use threads to keep channels readable</li>
        <li>React with emoji to acknowledge without adding noise</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p>
      Over time, these habits make teams more effective and make junior developers easier to collaborate with.

    <!-- Section 7: Final Mental Model -->
    <h2>Final Mental Model</h2>
    <p>
      If you already understand WhatsApp, Slack will feel familiar—but it should not be used the same way.
    </p>
    <p class="flow-diagram">
      <strong>Slack is not just chat.</strong><br><br>
      It is how teams think out loud together without losing track of what matters.
    </p>
    <p class="tip-box">
      Once you treat it that way, the tool starts working for you instead of distracting you.
