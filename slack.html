    <h1>What is Slack?</h1>
    <p>
      <strong>Slack</strong> describes itself as the “operating system for work” — a
      conversational interface that brings together people, processes and data【636834211350128†L120-L151】. Work happens in
      <em>channels</em>, which are dedicated spaces that bring the right people
      together【636834211350128†L130-L136】. With more than 2,600 apps in the Slack marketplace,
      you can integrate tools such as GitHub, Jira and Google Drive【636834211350128†L141-L145】.
    </p>

    <h2>Types of conversations</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Direct messages (DMs)</strong> – Use DMs for conversations between
        two people (up to eight). Keep them to small groups【598078870387260†L17-L27】.</li>
      <li><strong>Public channels</strong> – Most team discussions should take place
        in public channels so that decisions and context are visible to everyone【598078870387260†L30-L43】.</li>
      <li><strong>Private channels</strong> – Use private channels only for
        sensitive or confidential topics; only members of the channel can see
        the conversation【598078870387260†L45-L52】.</li>
      <li><strong>Team/important channels</strong> – Teams often have dedicated
        channels where announcements must be acknowledged with an emoji【598078870387260†L58-L63】.</li>
      <li><strong>Watercooler and feed channels</strong> – Use these for casual
        discussion and automated messages respectively【598078870387260†L64-L70】.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Good practices</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Label your channels</strong> – Use a predictable naming convention such as
        <code>brand–category–purpose</code> so team members can find information easily【598078870387260†L71-L78】.</li>
      <li><strong>Keep your profile updated</strong> – Ensure your Slack profile (name, avatar and
        time zone) is accurate so colleagues know who you are and when it’s appropriate to contact
        you【598078870387260†L82-L97】.</li>
      <li><strong>Move complex discussions to video</strong> – If a discussion requires more than
        a few back‑and‑forth messages, hop on a quick call and document decisions in the channel
        later【598078870387260†L97-L107】.</li>
      <li><strong>Write in paragraphs</strong> – Avoid sending many short messages; instead, write
        complete thoughts in a single message to reduce notification noise【598078870387260†L110-L120】.</li>
      <li><strong>Label your conversations and use threads</strong> – Start messages with a bold
        summary and reply in threads to keep conversations organized【598078870387260†L126-L144】.</li>
      <li><strong>Use checkmarks to acknowledge</strong> – When a message doesn’t require a
        response, react with a ✅ to indicate you’ve read it【598078870387260†L140-L152】.</li>
      <li><strong>Manage your Slack time</strong> – Set expectations for response times and block
        dedicated times to check Slack so you’re not distracted all day【598078870387260†L154-L167】.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Getting started with Slack</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Join or create a workspace</strong> – If your company already uses Slack, <a

      <li><strong>Complete your profile</strong> – Add a profile picture, name and time zone【598078870387260†L82-L97】.</li>
      <li><strong>Explore channels</strong> – Join the default channels (e.g., <code>#general</code>) and
        create new channels for specific projects or teams. Use public channels whenever possible【598078870387260†L30-L43】.</li>
      <li><strong>Send messages and threads</strong> – Start messages with a clear subject and use
        threads to keep discussions organized【598078870387260†L126-L144】.</li>
