    <h1>Why Teams Use Jira (and Why You Should Care)</h1>
    <p>
      <strong>Jira</strong> is a work-tracking system developed by Atlassian that helps engineering teams
      <strong>coordinate work</strong>, <strong>track progress</strong>, and <strong>communicate clearly</strong>—especially
      when multiple developers and teams are involved.
    </p>
    <p>
      For junior developers, Jira is not about "project management bureaucracy."
      It is about answering three simple questions:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>What am I working on right now?</strong></li>
      <li><strong>What is blocking me or others?</strong></li>
      <li><strong>How does my work fit into the team's bigger goal?</strong></li>
    </ol>
    <p class="tip-box">
      If Git/GitHub answers <em>how</em> we change code, Jira answers <em>why</em> we are changing it and <em>in what order</em>.
    </p>

    <!-- Section 2: Scrum Methodology -->
    <h2>Scrum Methodology (Very Short, Very Practical)</h2>
    <p>Most teams use <strong>Scrum</strong>, an agile framework built around short iterations called <strong>sprints</strong> (usually 1–2 weeks).</p>
    <p>At a high level:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Work is broken into <strong>tickets</strong></li>
      <li>Tickets are planned into a <strong>sprint</strong></li>
      <li>The team commits to finishing those tickets</li>
      <li>Progress is reviewed and adjusted continuously</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Jira acts as the <strong>single shared source of truth</strong> for this process:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>What is planned</li>
      <li>What is in progress</li>
      <li>What is done</li>
      <li>What is blocked</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="tip-box">
      For juniors: You are <strong>not expected to run Scrum</strong>.
      You <em>are expected</em> to understand how your tickets move through it.
    </p>

    <h3>Watch: Understanding Scrum</h3>
    <p>This video provides a good overview of the Scrum methodology:</p>

    <!-- Section 3: Core Jira Concepts -->
    <h2>Core Jira Concepts You Must Know</h2>

    <h3>Ticket (Issue)</h3>
    <p>A <strong>ticket</strong> represents a unit of work.</p>
    <p>Common types:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Story</strong> – a feature or functional requirement</li>
      <li><strong>Task</strong> – concrete technical work</li>
      <li><strong>Bug</strong> – something broken</li>
      <li><strong>Spike</strong> – investigation / research</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A ticket usually includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Title (short and clear)</li>
      <li>Description (what + why)</li>
      <li>Acceptance criteria (how we know it's done)</li>
      <li>Priority</li>
      <li>Assignee</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Board</h3>
    <p>The <strong>board</strong> visualizes work as it flows.</p>
    <p>Typical columns:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>To Do</li>
      <li>In Progress</li>
      <li>Code Review</li>
      <li>Done</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="tip-box">
      Rule of thumb: If you are coding, your ticket should be <strong>In Progress</strong>.
      If you stopped coding, update the ticket.
    </p>

    <h3>Sprint</h3>
    <p>A <strong>sprint</strong> is a time-boxed work cycle.</p>
    <p>As a junior:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You don't decide sprint scope</li>
      <li>You <em>do</em> own the tickets assigned to you</li>
      <li>You <em>do</em> communicate early if something slips</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Section 4: Basic Daily Use Cases -->
    <h2>Basic Daily Use Cases (Junior-Level Expectations)</h2>

    <h3>Starting Work on a Ticket</h3>
    <p>
      Before writing any code, the ticket should be read carefully and fully understood. This includes
      verifying that the requirements are clear and that there is no missing information or open question
      that could affect the implementation. If something is unclear, it should be clarified before starting work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once the task is understood, the ticket should be moved to <strong>In Progress</strong> so the board
      accurately reflects the current state of work. Only after that should development begin.
    </p>
    <p>
      A Git branch should then be created for the task, using a name that starts with the Jira ticket key.
      For example:
    </p>
    <pre><code>feature/JIRA-123-add-login-validation
bugfix/JIRA-456-fix-null-pointer</code></pre>
    <p>
      Following this convention allows Jira to automatically link commits and pull requests to the ticket,
      gives reviewers immediate context, and keeps the project history traceable and easy to follow.
    </p>

    <h3>Linking Code to Jira</h3>
    <p>Reference the Jira key (<code>JIRA-123</code>) in:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Branch name</li>
      <li>Commit message</li>
      <li>Pull Request title</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="flow-diagram">
      This creates <strong>automatic traceability</strong> between:<br><br>
      <strong>Ticket</strong> → <strong>Branch</strong> → <strong>PR</strong> → <strong>Code</strong>
    </p>

    <h3>Watch: Jira Terms and Workflow</h3>
    <p>This video helps you better understand Jira terms and the typical workflow:</p>

    <!-- Section 5: Jira vs Slack -->
    <h2>Jira vs Slack: What Goes Where</h2>
    <p>
      Jira and Slack serve very different purposes, and understanding the boundary between them is
      essential for working effectively in a team.
    </p>
    <div class="compare-grid">
      <div class="compare-box-primary">
        <h4>Jira (Permanent Record)</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Work is defined and tracked</li>
          <li>Requirements documented</li>
          <li>Technical decisions recorded</li>
          <li>Status changes logged</li>
          <li>Blockers noted</li>
          <li>Context preserved for future</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="compare-box-secondary">
        <h4>Slack (Fast Communication)</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Quick questions</li>
          <li>Short clarifications</li>
          <li>Coordination requests</li>
          <li>Asking for reviews</li>
          <li>Urgent issues</li>
          <li>Temporary discussions</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p class="tip-box">
      <strong>Rule of thumb:</strong> If a conversation influences the work itself or the timeline in any way,
      it should be captured in Jira—even if it started in Slack. Slack can start the discussion, but Jira
      is where the outcome belongs.
    </p>

    <!-- Section 6: Priorities and Blockers -->
    <h2>Priorities, Blockers, and Professional Communication</h2>
    <p>
      In most teams, priorities are not arbitrary. They are set by Team Leads or Product Managers based on
      broader considerations such as delivery timelines, dependencies between teams, and business impact.
      As a junior developer, your responsibility is to respect the assigned priority order and focus on the
      task you were given. It is generally not expected—and often not helpful—to switch tasks or "self-promote"
      work unless you were explicitly asked to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blockers are a normal part of software development, especially early on. What matters is not avoiding
      them, but handling them professionally and transparently.
    </p>

    <div class="checklist-box">
      <h4>When You Are Blocked</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Update the Jira ticket so the team can see that progress has stopped</li>
        <li>Clearly explain what is blocking you, including what you have already tried</li>
        <li>Tag the relevant person who can help resolve the issue</li>
        <li>Mention the blocker in stand-ups if your team has them</li>
      </ol>
    </div>
    <p class="tip-box">
      The key principle is <strong>visibility</strong>. Being blocked and communicating it early is far
      better than staying silent and missing expectations. Teams can help you only if they know there is a problem.
    </p>

    <!-- Section 7: What Juniors Are Not Expected to Do -->
    <h2>What Juniors Are Not Expected to Do</h2>
    <ul class="avoid-list">
      <li>Configure Jira workflows</li>
      <li>Create new project schemas</li>
      <li>Manage sprint capacity</li>
      <li>Define team-level metrics</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="checklist-box">
      <h4>Your Focus as a Junior</h4>
      <ul class="checklist">
        <li>Understanding tickets</li>
        <li>Updating status honestly</li>
        <li>Linking code properly</li>
        <li>Communicating clearly</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- Section 8: Final Mental Model -->
    <h2>Final Mental Model</h2>
    <p class="flow-diagram">
      <strong>Git/GitHub</strong> = code execution<br><br>
      <strong>Jira</strong> = work coordination<br><br>
      <strong>Slack</strong> = real-time communication
    </p>
    <p class="tip-box">
      Strong juniors are not judged only by code quality, but by how reliably others can <strong>work with them</strong>.
