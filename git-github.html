    <h1>How to Work with Git + GitHub</h1>
    <p>
      This guide is not meant to turn you into a Git expert. It's meant to make you
      <strong>productive and safe</strong> when working with a real team on a real codebase.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are often many ways to accomplish the same task in Git. Choose the approach that works
      best for you. While it's best to know how to work with Git on the command line, starting with
      a friendly UI like <strong>GitHub Desktop</strong> can be a good option to start and better
      understand the right flows, then later move to the command line.
    </p>
    <p class="tip-box">
      If you remember only one idea, remember this: <strong>Git is the "save system" for software teams</strong>,
      and GitHub is the place where those saved changes become visible, reviewable, testable, and mergeable
      by the team. Your job isn't only to write code — it's to write code in a way that the team can
      <strong>trust</strong>, <strong>review</strong>, and <strong>integrate</strong> without drama.
    </p>

    <!-- Section 1: Git Concepts -->
    <h2>1) Git Concepts (Mental Model)</h2>
    <p>It helps to have one simple picture in your head:</p>

    <p class="flow-diagram">
      <strong>Remote repo (GitHub)</strong> → you clone it → <strong>local repo (your machine)</strong><br><br>
      Then you work like this:<br><br>
      <strong>branch</strong> → [edit → stage → commit] × repeat → merge locally → push → <strong>Pull Request</strong> → review → merge PR
    </p>

    <p>That's it. Everything else is variations of this loop.</p>

    <img src="images/git_page/work_like_this.png" alt="Git Clone Flow Diagram" class="content-image" />

    <h3>Repo: Local vs Remote</h3>
    <p>
      A <strong>repository (repo)</strong> is your project folder plus its entire history of changes.
      You always have two "copies" of the repo in your workflow:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your <strong>local repo</strong>, which is your private working space on your laptop</li>
      <li>The <strong>remote repo</strong>, usually called <code>origin</code>, which lives on GitHub and is shared with the team</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When people say "push to GitHub", they mean "send my local commits to the remote repo".</p>

    <h3>Commit History: The Timeline of the Project</h3>
    <p>
      Git doesn't store "versions of files" like Google Docs. It stores a <strong>history of changes</strong>
      as a chain of commits. A <strong>commit</strong> is a snapshot of work with a message that explains
      what changed and why. Over time, the project becomes a story made of commits.
    </p>
    <p>
      This matters because when something breaks, you don't want to guess. You want to know
      <em>exactly when</em> it broke and <em>what changed</em> right before it.
    </p>

    <h3>Branch: Your Private Lane of Work</h3>
    <p>
      A <strong>branch</strong> is the safest way to work on a feature without disturbing the stable
      code everyone else depends on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Think of <code>main</code> as "the shared highway" and your branch as "your lane". You build
      your feature in your lane, and when it's ready, you merge it back through a Pull Request.
    </p>

    <h3>Working Directory vs Staging</h3>
    <p>Git separates changes into two layers:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Working directory</strong>: files you edited (your work-in-progress)</li>
      <li><strong>Staging area</strong>: files you selected to include in the next commit (your next "save point")</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Staging exists so you can control <em>what exactly</em> goes into the commit. That makes commits clean and reviewable.</p>

    <h3>Pull Request (PR): How Teamwork Actually Happens</h3>
    <p>A Pull Request is not just a button you click at the end. It's a workflow tool. A PR is where:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your change becomes visible to the team</li>
      <li>Tests/CI can run automatically (if the repo has it)</li>
      <li>Feedback can happen before anything touches <code>main</code></li>
      <li>Your work is approved by the right people</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The PR is usually reviewed by:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The <strong>team lead</strong> (to ensure quality, architecture, and consistency)</li>
      <li><strong>Coworkers working on related code</strong> (to catch mistakes and coordinate behavior)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The goal of review is not to "judge" you. It's to prevent the entire team from wasting time later.</p>

    <!-- Section 2: Core Commands -->
    <h2>2) The Core Commands (Minimal Set)</h2>
    <p>You don't need 50 commands. You need a small set that you can execute confidently. If you master these, you can contribute to almost any team project.</p>

    <h3><code>git clone</code></h3>
    <p>This is how you get the project onto your machine for the first time.</p>
    <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/org/project.git</code></pre>

    <h3><code>git status</code></h3>
    <p>This is your dashboard. Use it constantly. It tells you what you changed and what's staged.</p>
    <pre><code>git status</code></pre>

    <h3><code>git checkout -b &lt;branch&gt;</code></h3>
    <p>This creates a new branch and moves you into it. You do this before you start a task.</p>
    <pre><code>git checkout -b feature/login-ui
# OR
git switch -c feature/login-ui</code></pre>

    <h3><code>git add</code></h3>
    <p>This moves changes into the staging area (meaning: "this goes into my next commit").</p>
    <pre><code>git add .
# OR stage a single file:
git add src/app.js</code></pre>

    <h3><code>git commit -m</code></h3>
    <p>This creates a save point with a message.</p>
    <pre><code>git commit -m "Add login form validation"</code></pre>

    <h3><code>git push -u origin &lt;branch&gt;</code></h3>
    <p>This uploads your branch to GitHub so the team can see it (and so you can open a PR).</p>
    <pre><code>git push -u origin feature/login-ui</code></pre>

    <h3><code>git pull --rebase</code></h3>
    <p>This pulls new commits from the remote and places your commits on top, keeping history clean.</p>
    <pre><code>git pull --rebase</code></pre>

    <h3><code>git log --oneline</code></h3>
    <p>This shows commit history quickly. It helps you understand what happened recently.</p>
    <pre><code>git log --oneline</code></pre>

    <h3><code>git diff</code></h3>
    <p>This shows what changed before you commit. It prevents accidental junk commits.</p>
    <pre><code>git diff</code></pre>

    <p class="tip-box">
      Remember: almost all of these commands can also be executed via GUI tools like <strong>GitHub Desktop</strong>.
    </p>

    <!-- Section 3: Real Workflow -->
    <h2>3) The Real Workflow (What You Do Every Time)</h2>
    <p>
      Think of this as your daily operating system for Git. The goal isn't perfection — it's consistency.
      When everyone follows the same flow, you avoid most Git pain and keep <code>main</code> stable for the whole team.
    </p>

    <p>You almost always begin the same way: <strong>sync the branch you're branching from</strong>, so you don't build on stale code.</p>
    <pre><code>git checkout main
git pull --rebase</code></pre>

    <p>Now create a dedicated branch for your task:</p>
    <pre><code>git checkout -b feature/&lt;short-name&gt;</code></pre>

    <p class="tip-box">
      <strong>Make many local commits while working — like pressing "Save" in Word.</strong><br><br>
      A commit is not "the final version." It's a checkpoint. Frequent commits protect you from losing progress,
      make debugging easier ("what changed right before it broke?"), and make code review smoother because
      your changes are a clear sequence instead of one huge dump.
    </p>

    <p>A good rhythm is simple: finish one meaningful step → commit → continue.</p>
    <pre><code>git status
git diff
git add .
git commit -m "Add login form validation"</code></pre>

    <p>When you're ready to share your work, push the branch to GitHub and open a Pull Request:</p>
    <pre><code>git push -u origin feature/&lt;short-name&gt;</code></pre>

    <p>
      A PR is where your code becomes teamwork: it gets reviewed, tested, and merged in a controlled way.
      A PR typically needs approval from the <strong>team lead</strong> (quality/architecture) and teammates
      working in the same area. Treat review as collaboration: respond to comments, improve the code,
      push updates, and keep the PR focused until it's ready to merge.
    </p>

    <p class="tip-box">
      <strong>Branch from the branch you want to merge into</strong> (your "parent branch").<br><br>
      If your work should merge into <code>main</code>, branch from <code>main</code>.
      If your work is part of an existing feature branch, branch from that feature branch instead.
    </p>

    <pre><code>git checkout feature/payments
git pull --rebase
git checkout -b bugfix/payments-null-check</code></pre>

    <!-- YouTube Video Section -->
    <h2>Watch: Understanding Pull Requests</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Please watch this short video</strong> to understand what is expected when creating a PR.
      It will also discuss briefly what we have covered and will be covering, so it will be a good intuition and reference:

    <!-- Section 4: Branching Best Practices -->
    <h2>4) Branching Best Practices (How Teams Stay Sane)</h2>
    <p>Branching rules exist for one reason: <strong>coordination</strong>. On a team, chaos is expensive.</p>

    <p>A good branch is:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Narrow in scope</li>
      <li>Easy to understand</li>
      <li>Easy to review</li>
      <li>Easy to revert if needed</li>
    </ul>

    <p>That's why the default behavior is "one branch per task".</p>

    <h3>Branch Naming</h3>
    <p>
      Branch naming doesn't need to be perfect, but it must be predictable. A branch name should tell
      reviewers what it is without opening the PR.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>feature/login-ui</code></li>
      <li><code>bugfix/null-check-orders</code></li>
      <li><code>hotfix/prod-crash</code></li>
    </ul>

    <p class="tip-box">
      <strong>Avoid working directly on <code>main</code>.</strong><br>
      Even if you're "just changing one small thing". The one small thing is exactly how teams break <code>main</code>.
    </p>

    <!-- Section 5: Before Opening a PR -->
    <h2>5) Before Opening a PR</h2>
    <p>
      If you open a PR too early with incomplete work, the team lead and reviewers waste time reviewing
      something that isn't ready. If you open a PR too late with a huge change, reviewers waste time
      reviewing a monster.
    </p>
    <p>
      The goal is simple: open a PR when it is <strong>coherent</strong>, <strong>testable</strong>,
      and <strong>small enough to review</strong>.
    </p>

    <div class="checklist-box">
      <h4>PR Ready Checklist (Do This Every Time)</h4>
      <ul class="checklist">
        <li>You pulled the latest changes from the parent branch (<code>main</code> or the relevant feature branch)</li>
        <li>Conflicts are resolved locally</li>
        <li>The project builds / runs</li>
        <li>Relevant tests were run</li>
        <li>No debug prints, temporary hacks, or "commented-out solutions"</li>
        <li>Formatting/linting is acceptable (if the repo enforces it)</li>
        <li>PR scope is focused (not multiple unrelated changes in one PR)</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- Section 6: When Things Go Wrong -->
    <h2>6) When Things Go Wrong (Common Fixes)</h2>
    <p>
      You will eventually hit problems. That's normal. The goal isn't to avoid problems — it's to have
      safe default fixes.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's also important to understand that "things going wrong" does <strong>not</strong> mean you failed.
      In real teams, it is completely normal to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Get a <strong>push rejected</strong> because the branch moved forward</li>
      <li>Open a PR and then be asked to <strong>fix issues</strong> after review</li>
    </ul>
    <p>That feedback loop is not a punishment — it's the workflow doing its job.</p>

    <h3>Case 1: "My push was rejected because remote has new commits"</h3>
    <p>This happens when your branch on GitHub has moved forward (usually because someone pushed updates, or you're behind).</p>
    <p><strong>Safe fix:</strong></p>
    <pre><code>git pull --rebase
git push</code></pre>

    <h3>Case 2: "I opened a PR to the wrong branch"</h3>
    <p>This is more common than people admit. It's not a disaster.</p>
    <p><strong>Safe fix:</strong> On GitHub, edit the PR and change the base branch to the correct parent branch.</p>

    <h3>Case 3: "Reviewers requested changes and now I need to fix things"</h3>
    <p>This is one of the most common situations in professional development. Once a PR is open, your job is simple: treat review comments like a to-do list.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Go back to your <strong>local feature branch</strong></li>
      <li>Fix the issues <strong>one by one</strong></li>
      <li>Re-test whatever is relevant</li>
      <li>Commit your fixes (small, clean commits are ideal)</li>
      <li>Push the updates to the remote branch</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="tip-box">
      <strong>You do not open a new PR.</strong> Once a PR exists, pushing more commits to the same branch
      will <strong>automatically update the PR</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>When you're done, communicate clearly: reply to review comments, explain what you changed, and re-request review.</p>

    <h3>Case 4: "I accidentally committed to main"</h3>
    <p>The key is: don't panic, and don't push.</p>
    <p><strong>Safe fix:</strong></p>
    <pre><code># Move your work into a proper feature branch
git checkout -b feature/move-accidental-main-work

# Restore main to its expected state
git checkout main
git pull --rebase

# Push your feature branch and open a PR
git push -u origin feature/move-accidental-main-work</code></pre>

    <!-- Final Mindset -->
    <h2>Final Mindset (How Good Teams Work)</h2>
    <p>If you work like this consistently:</p>

    <div class="do-dont-grid">
      <div class="do-box">
        <h4>Do</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Branch before you start</li>
          <li>Commit often as checkpoints</li>
          <li>Keep changes small and readable</li>
          <li>Sync with the parent branch</li>
          <li>Open PRs that are testable and focused</li>
          <li>Take review seriously and collaborate</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="dont-box">
        <h4>Don't</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Work directly on <code>main</code></li>
          <li>Make one giant commit at the end</li>
          <li>Open PRs without testing</li>
          <li>Ignore review feedback</li>
          <li>Fix conflicts on GitHub if avoidable</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>Then Git becomes boring — and that's the goal. When Git is boring, your team moves fast.</p>
