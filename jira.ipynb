    "\n",
    "**Jira** is a work-tracking system developed by Atlassian that helps engineering teams **coordinate work**, **track progress**, and **communicate clearly**—especially when multiple developers and teams are involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "For junior developers, Jira is not about “project management bureaucracy.”\n",
    "It is about answering three simple questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **What am I working on right now?**\n",
    "2. **What is blocking me or others?**\n",
    "3. **How does my work fit into the team’s bigger goal?**\n",

    "### Starting Work on a Ticket\n",
    "\n",
    "Before writing any code, the ticket should be read carefully and fully understood. This includes verifying that the requirements are clear and that there is no missing information or open question that could affect the implementation. If something is unclear, it should be clarified before starting work.\n",

    "## 5. Jira vs Slack: What Goes Where\n",
    "\n",
    "Jira and Slack serve very different purposes, and understanding the boundary between them is essential for working effectively in a team.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jira is the place where **work is defined, tracked, and remembered**. Anything that affects how a task is implemented, when it will be completed, or why a certain decision was made should live in Jira. This includes requirements, technical decisions, status changes, and blockers. Jira is also where context should be preserved—if someone needs to understand the task a week or a month later, the relevant information should be there.\n",
    "\n",
    "Slack, on the other hand, is designed for **fast, temporary communication**. It is ideal for quick questions, short clarifications, coordination requests (such as asking for a review), and urgent issues that require immediate attention. Slack conversations move quickly and are not meant to serve as long-term documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "A useful rule of thumb is this: if a conversation influences the work itself or the timeline in any way, it should be captured in Jira—even if it started in Slack. Slack can start the discussion, but Jira is where the outcome belongs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keeping this separation ensures that the team can move quickly without losing important context, and that anyone joining or reviewing the work later can understand what happened and why.\n",

    "## 6. Priorities, Blockers, and Professional Communication\n",
    "\n",
    "In most teams, priorities are not arbitrary. They are set by Team Leads or Product Managers based on broader considerations such as delivery timelines, dependencies between teams, and business impact. As a junior developer, your responsibility is to respect the assigned priority order and focus on the task you were given. It is generally not expected—and often not helpful—to switch tasks or “self-promote” work unless you were explicitly asked to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "Blockers are a normal part of software development, especially early on. What matters is not avoiding them, but handling them professionally and transparently. If you are blocked, your first step should be to update the Jira ticket so the team can see that progress has stopped. You should then clearly explain what is blocking you, including what you have already tried, and tag the relevant person who can help resolve the issue. If your team has stand-ups, the blocker should also be mentioned there.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key principle is visibility. Being blocked and communicating it early is far better than staying silent and missing expectations. Teams can help you only if they know there is a problem.\n",
